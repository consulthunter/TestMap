TestMap is a tool for gathering software tests from C# repositories from GitHub and other Git based developer platforms.

It collects software tests using SyntaxTrees and the Roslyn API.
## Dependencies

- .NET SDK 9.0 or greater
  - [Instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)
  - For Windows, winget is suggested
       
       ```winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.9```

  __Note: dotnet needs to be on PATH. Make sure that ```dotnet --version``` works through the CLI__

- Git
  - [Instructions](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- Docker Desktop
  - [Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/)

  __Note: TestMap has been tested on Windows 11 and MacOS__

## Installation

Create a directory, named ```Projects```.
```sh
mkdir Projects
```

Navigate to the ```Projects``` directory.
```sh
cd ./Projects/
```

Create a directory, named ```TestMap```.
```sh
mkdir TestMap
```

Navigate to the `TestMap` directory.
```sh
cd ./TestMap/
```

Download and Extract the latest release.

Change into the Release directory:
```sh
cd Release
```

## Usage
Generate config file:
```sh
./TestMap.exe setup
```
This will generate the file `./Config/default-config.json`. This will hold the configuration for running the rest of the project.

Next try running the project:
```sh
./TestMap.exe collect-tests --config <PATH TO CONFIG FILE>
```
- _Note_: Update path to the file generated by `./TestMap.exe setup`

For more details on how to configure and use this tool see [here.](./Docs/HOW-TO-USE.md)

## Testing

Unit tests for TestMap are generally run through GitHub Actions.

Integration tests typically need to be done locally.

For details on testing you can find more information [here.](./Docs/TESTING.md)
