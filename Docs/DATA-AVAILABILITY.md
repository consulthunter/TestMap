# Data Availability

We used TestMap to collect data from open-source repositories.

The list of repositories is located [here.](../Scripts/collectRepos/repositories_urls.txt)

From this list of repositories, we created two datasets both available on HuggingFace.

For more information on how this data was collected see [this.](HOW-IT-WORKS.md)

## CSharpTestMethods

A collection of 645,274 unique records of test methods and methods invoked in the test with their definitions.

The dataset is available [here.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Distaste1194/CSharpTestMethods)

## CSharpTestClasses

A collection of 14,589 unique records of test classes and their corresponding source code classes (classes being tests).

The dataset is available [here.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Distaste1194/CSharpTestClasses)
